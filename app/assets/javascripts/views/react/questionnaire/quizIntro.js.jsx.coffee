				<p><i>Overview</i><br />
				This online app measures your personal sense of purpose and meaning using the Meaning and Purpose Questionnaire, a tool developed by Intentional Insights using recent research in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and other fields.</p>
				<p><i>How to Complete the Questionnaire</i><br />
				Rank the following statements on a scale of 1 (absolutely not true) to 10 (absolutely true)<br />
				If you’d like, you may use the area below the number rank to write an explanation of why you answered the way you did. The explanation will not affect your score, but you will be able to review your comments later.<br />
				You may complete the questionnaire as often as you’d like, but no more than once per day.<br />
				Click on Graphs above to track your personal sense of purpose and meaning over time.</p>
